<h1>Rendering Lists</h1>

- To render a single or multiple components from an array/collection of data, use JavaScript array methods, eg, `Array.map()`. Reference: [renderingLists.jsx](renderingLists.jsx).

- When building UI, you may need to show several instances/data of same component by using JavaScript array methods. Meaning, have declare a function/component that displays several data in a list.
