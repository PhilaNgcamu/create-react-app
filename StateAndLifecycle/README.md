<h1>State and Lifecycle</h1>

- Ideally, we want to give the component full control on how it updates the UI with depending on other smaller functions in order to achieve encapsulation (hiding values in a class). That's where classes come in. Reference: [stateAndLifecycle.jsx](stateAndLifecycle.jsx).

Defining methods in a class allows us the add new features in a class, where our goal is to render, `<Component />`
