# Introducing JSX

JSX - a syntax extension of JavaScript

Why use JSX?

- React uses a form of abstraction called separation of concerns - a term used to describe a design principle separate a computer program into distinct sections, while "hiding" the implementation of the program. Example, <h1>Hello, World</h1>, where "h1" is a syntax extension of JavaScript (JSX)

- You can put (embed) any valid JavaScript expression in JSX. Reference, **intro.jsx**
