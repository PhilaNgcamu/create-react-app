<h1>Reacting to Input with State</h1>

- React uses a declarative way to manipulate the UI instead of manipulating the UI with different pieces. For example, a form has a submit button that is disabled when there's no text. So, using pure JavaScript, you should make a _command_/line of code responsible for that UI. If the form gets to complex, it will be not wise to focus on have many lines of code because it would be buggy.
