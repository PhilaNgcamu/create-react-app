<h1>State</h1>

- Compenents may often change the display of the DOM as a result of an interaction or a method. This is called, **state** - which is a component-specific memory. An example of this might be clicking the "next" button on the image carousal to display different images.

- In React, **useState** as well as any other function starting with **use** is called a **Hook**, which are special functions that are only available while React is rendering. Reference: [state.jsx](state.jsx)
