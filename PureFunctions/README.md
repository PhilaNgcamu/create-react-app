<h1>Keeping Functions Pure</h1>

- Pure functions only involves calculation, without affecting the input data - which helps to avoid bugs and unpredictable behaviour. Hence, all communication in React must happen through props.

- React is designed around the concept of pure functions. The same input should return the same output, provided that it returns JSX. Reference: [pureFunctions.jsx](pureFunctions.jsx).
